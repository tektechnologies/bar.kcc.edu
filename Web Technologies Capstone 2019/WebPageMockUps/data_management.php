		<h1>Career Pathways > Data Management</h1>
<p>Information that someone uses to make decisions is called data. The Data Management/Strategy job family creates systems that store data (databases) that make it easy to fnd the data when the organization needs to use it. They also manage and analyze data to help organizations use it more effectively. These jobs may be a good fit for those who enjoy working with numbers and are good at paying attention to detail and problem solving.</p>
