Computer systems need two major elements to work: hardware and software. Hardware is the part of computer systems that you can physically touch (e.g. keyboard, monitor). Software is a collection of instructions that allow a computer to work (e.g. apps). Careers in application design involve creating new application software or improving existing software. Employees under this job family have excellent technical and design skills.
