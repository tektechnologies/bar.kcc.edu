Every company needs computers to do business. They also need these computers to connect with one another so that employees can share information. When many computers connect to each other, this is called a network. The information that they share via the network is stored in something called a database–think of a big digital file cabinet. People in infrastructure jobs make sure that the computers in the network are connected and working and that information in the company’s databases can be viewed by others. People in these jobs are good at organizing things, pay close attention to details, and think creatively.
